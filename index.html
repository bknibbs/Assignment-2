                                Black Unemployment rate in New York City has remained a consistent issue for black New Yorkers. While there is no change in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate which remains at 5.3% since August, among black New Yorkers, there is a 9.9% rate according to a recent monthly report, conducted by the New York City Economic Development Corporation. 
                                A portion of black youth who are ages 18-24 years old and is reported being “out of school, out of work” is 26%.

                                Late last year, New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli released a report that shows that the rate for young workers reached the double digits of 22%, with black youth workers reaching 20.4%.

                                Black Youth Unemployment rate plays into what is described as an uneven economy as the city is still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic.

                                “Some of those industries that have been a foothold in the labor market for so many young people in New York City, industries like retail, like restaurants, hospitality, those are the industries that are very slow to recover.” said Eli Dvorkin, Editorial and Policy Director at the Center for an Urban Future, a non-profit.

                                “Even though we nearly gained all of the jobs that we lost, we haven't gained those jobs across all industries and some of the industries that were hit the hardest with a lingering, longest economic damage from the pandemic, are industries that have long been a way into the economy for young people,” he said.
